## Proofers ##

This is a book of lyrics--no music notation or sheets. If you enjoy proofing poetry, that's essentially what this book is. [Poetry proofing guidelines](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofreading_Guidelines#Poetry/Epigrams).

You'll find ** occasional words in Greek ** (not many!). The basic Greek character set is available in the character picker. Let me know if you find any "accented" Greek characters, and I will add the polytonic Greek set.

Please correct the text to MATCH the scan. Place any suggested corrections within the [** correction?] [proofer's note](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Writing_Good_Proofer%27s_Notes), not within the text itself. Question anything that doesn't seem right/correct/consistent to alert the post-processor to potential issues.

_ If a page does not start in the middle of a paragraph/stanza nor is it a [Blank Page], put a blank line at the top if there isn‚Äôt one. _

** If you find any characters not available in the picker sets, please post details in the project forum so I can add them to the custom suite for this project. **

Otherwise, please follow the [standard proofing guidelines](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofreading_Guidelines).

## Word Check ##

I recommend, though don't require, P1s use the [Word Check](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/WordCheck_FAQ) function. I'm always amazed what it catches when I do P1 pages! Plus, it great practice for P2 and P3, where Word Check is ** mandatory.**

Pages proofed in P2 and P3 without Word Check may be cleared.

** Words to Suggest for the Good Word List: **

* ** Correct: ** proper nouns, words in foreign languages if they match the scan.
    * _Don't forget you can add more languages for Word Check to analyze at the top of the WC interface!_
* ** Incorrect: ** partial words, abbreviations, scannos (which need to be corrected üòä), typos (which need a proofer‚Äôs note üòâ), unclear words, and words you are unsure about or just seem odd to you.

## Formatters ##

* This is a book of song lyrics, LYRICS only--despite the title. Please ** treat each lyric as a poem**, following the [poetry formatting guidelines](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Formatting/Formatting_Guidelines#Poetry/Epigrams) and the [LoFE](https://www.pgdp.net/c/tools/page_browser.php?project=projectID4d5c4875855d0&imagefile=122-00A.png).
* Please treat each numbered book, as seen in the Table of Contents, as a chapter (4 blank lines).
* Please treat each individual lyric/poem within each book as a section. (2 blank lines)
* The small-caps look as though they are slightly spaced out; treat these as regular small-caps.

Please follow the [standard formatting guidelines](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Formatting/Formatting_Guidelines) and [LoFE](https://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=47569&sid=133fe918c7d3450892d1f9bf3b7acad0).
