DEDICATION.

TO THE

MARCHIONESS DOWAGER OF DONEGAL.


It is now many years since, in a Letter prefixed
to the Third Number of the Irish Melodies,
I had the pleasure of inscribing the Poems of
that work to your Ladyship, as to a person whose
character reflected honour on the country to
which they relate, and whose friendship had
long been the pride and happiness of their author.
With the same feelings of affection and
respect, confirmed if not increased by the experience
of every successive year, I now place
those Poems, in their present new form, under
your protection, and am,

/*
with perfect sincerity, your
Ladyship's ever attached friend,

THOMAS MOORE.

PREFACE.


Though an edition of the Poetry of the
Irish Melodies, separate from the Music,
has long been called for, yet having, for
many reasons, a strong objection to this
sort of divorce, I should with difficulty have
consented to a disunion of the words from the
airs, had it depended solely upon me to keep
them quietly and indissolubly together. But,
besides the various shapes in which these, as
well as my other lyrical writings, have been
published throughout America, they are included,
of course, in the two editions of all
my works printed at Paris, and have lately
appeared, in a volume full of typographical
errors, in Dublin. I have, therefore, readily
acceded to the wish of the Proprietor of the
Irish Melodies for a revised and complete
-----File: f008.png--------------------------------------------------------
edition of the Poetry of the Eight Numbers,
though well aware that it is impossible for
these verses to be detached from the beautiful
airs to which they were associated,
without losing even more than the "<i>animæ
dimidium</i>" in the process.

The advertisements, which were prefixed
to the different numbers, the Prefatory Letter
upon Music, &c., will be found in an
Appendix at the end of the Volume.

FIRST NUMBER.

Page

Go where glory waits thee                            3

Remember the glories of Brien the brave        6

Erin! the tear and the smile in thine eyes        9

Oh! breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade        10

When he who adores thee, has left but the name        11

The harp that once through Tara's halls      12

Fly not yet, 'tis just the hour                    13

Oh! think not my spirits are always as light        15

Tho' the last glimpse of Erin with sorrow I see        17

Rich and rare were the gems she wore         19

As a beam o'er the face of the waters may glow        21

There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet        22


SECOND NUMBER.

Oh! haste and leave this sacred isle        27

How dear to me the hour when day-light dies       29

Take back the virgin page                           30

When in death I shall calm recline       32

How oft has the Benshee cried                       34

We may roam thro' this world, like a child at a feast         36

Oh! weep for the hour                               38
*/

/*

Let Erin remember the days of old        40

Silent, oh Moyle! be the roar of thy water     42

Come, send round the wine, and leave points of belief       44

Sublime was the warning which Liberty spoke         45

Believe me, if all those endearing young charms        47


THIRD NUMBER.

Like the bright lamp that shone in Kildare's holy fane        51

Drink to her, who long                              53

Oh! blame not the bard, if he fly to the bowers        55

While gazing on the moon's light        58

When day-light was yet sleeping under the billow        60

By the hope within us springing        62

Night clos'd around the conqueror's way      64

Oh! 'tis sweet to think, that, where'er we roam        65

Through grief and through danger        67

When thro' life unblest we rove                     69

It is not the tear, at this moment shed      71

'Tis believ'd that this harp, which I wake now     72


FOURTH NUMBER.

Oh! the days are gone, when beauty bright       77

Tho' dark are our sorrows, to-day we'll forget them       79

Weep on, weep on, your hour is past      82

Lesbia hath a beaming eye                      84

I saw thy form in youthful prime      86

By that lake, whose gloomy shore       88

She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps      91

Nay, tell me not, dear, that the goblet drowns       93

Avenging and bright fall the swift sword of Erin        95

What the bee is to the floweret                97

Here we dwell, in holiest bowers        98

This life is all chequer'd with pleasures and woes         100

FIFTH NUMBER.

Through Erin's Isle                     105

At the mid hour of night, when stars are weeping, I fly        108

One bumper at parting!--tho' many      109

'Tis the last rose of summer              111

The young May moon is beaming, love       113

The minstrel-boy to the war is gone      115

The valley lay smiling before me        116

Oh! had we some bright little isle of our own       119

Farewell, but, whenever you welcome the hour        121

Oh! doubt me not--the season               123

You remember Ellen, our hamlet's pride       125

I'd mourn the hopes that leave me        127


SIXTH NUMBER.

Come o'er the sea                         131

Has sorrow thy young days shaded          133

No, no not more welcome the fairy numbers        136

When first I met thee, warm and young        137

While history's muse the memorial was keeping       140

The time I've lost in wooing              142

Where is the slave, so lowly              144

Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer        146

'Tis gone, and for ever, the light we saw breaking        147

I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining        149

Fill the bumper fair                     151

Dear harp of my country, in darkness I found thee       154


SEVENTH NUMBER.

My gentle harp, once more I waken       159

As slow our ship her foamy track       161

In the morning of life, when its cares are unknown        163

When cold in the earth lies the friend thou hast lov'd          165

be allowed to fight with the rest.--"<i>Let stakes</i> (they said) <i>be
stuck in the ground, and suffer each of us, tied to and supported
by one of these stakes, to be placed in his rank by the side

[Footnote A: In the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Henry VIII. an
Act was made respecting the habits, and dress in general, of
the Irish, whereby all persons were restrained from being shorn
or shaven above the ears, or from wearing Glibbes, or <i>Coulins</i>,
(long locks) on their heads, or hair on their upper lip, called
Crommeal. On this occasion a song was written by one of our
bards, in which an Irish virgin is made to give the preference
to her dear <i>Coulin</i>, (or the youth with the flowing locks) to all
strangers, (by which the English were meant) or those who
wore their habits. Of this song the air alone has reached
us, and is universally admired."[**not clear where the quote starts] <sc>Walker's Historical Memoirs
of Irish Bards</sc>, page 134. Mr. Walker informs us
also, that about the same period, there were some harsh measures
taken against the Irish Minstrels.]

[Footnote A: This ballad is founded upon the following anecdote: "The
people were inspired with such a spirit of honour, virtue and
religion, by the great example of Brien, and by his excellent
administration, that, as a proof of it, we are informed that a
young lady of great beauty, adorned with jewels and a costly
dress, undertook a journey alone from one end of the kingdom
to the other, with a wand only in her hand, at the top of which
was a ring of exceeding great value; and such an impression
had the laws and government of this Monarch made on the
minds of all the people, that no attempt was made upon her
honour, nor was she robbed of her clothes or jewels."--<sc>Warner's
History of Ireland</sc>, Vol. 1, Book 10.]

ST. SENANUS AND THE LADY.

/*
"Oh! haste and leave this sacred isle,
"Unholy bark, ere morning smile;
"For on thy deck, tho' dark it be,

"And I have sworn this sainted sod
"Shall ne'er by woman's feet be trod!"
*/

[Footnote A: In a metrical life of St. Senanus, which is taken from an
old Kilkenny MS. and may be found among the <i>Acta Sanctorum
Hiberniæ</i>, we are told of his flight to the island of Scattery, and
his resolution not to admit any woman of the party; he refused
to receive even a sister saint, St. Cannera, whom an angel had
taken to the island, for the express purpose of introducing her
to him. The following was the ungracious answer of Senanus,
according to his poetical biographer:

/*
<i>Cui Præsul, quid fœminis
Commune est cum monachis?
Nec te nec ullam aliam
Admittemus in insulam.</i>

See the <sc>Acta Sanct. Hib.</sc> Page 610.

than the River Shannon; but O'Connor, and other
Antiquarians, deny this metamorphose indignantly.]

The Lady's prayer <sc>Senanus</sc> spurn'd;
The winds blew fresh, the bark return'd.

  Till morning's light delay'd,
And given the saint one rosy smile,
She ne'er had left his lonely isle.

When shall the swan, her death-note singing,

[Footnote A: To make this story intelligible in a song, would require a
much greater number of verses than any one is authorized to
inflict upon an audience at once; the reader must therefore be
content to learn, in a note, that Fionnuala, the daughter of Lir,
was, by some supernatural power, transformed into a Swan,
and condemned to wander, for many hundred years, over certain
lakes and rivers in Ireland, till the coming of Christianity, when
the first sound of the mass-bell was to be the signal of her release.--I

The string, that now languishes loose o'er the lyre,

[Footnote A: We may suppose this apology to have been uttered by one
of those wandering bards, whom Spencer so severely, and,
perhaps, truly, describes in his State of Ireland, and whose
poems, he tells us, "Were sprinkled with some pretty flowers
of their natural device, which gave good grace and comeliness
unto them, the which it is great pity to see abused to the gracing
of wickedness and vice, which, with good usage, would serve to
adorn and beautify virtue."]

[Footnote B: It is conjectured by Wormius, that the name of Ireland is
derived from <i>Yr</i>, the Runic for a <i>bow</i>, in the use of which weapon
the Irish were once very expert. This derivation is certainly
more creditable to us than the following, "So that Ireland,
(called the land of <i>Ire</i>, for the constant broils therein for 400
years,) was now become the land of concord." Lloyd's State
worthies, Art. The Lord Grandison.]

of Usnach," which has been translated literally from the Gaelic,
by Mr. <sc>O'Flanagan</sc>, (see vol. I. of <i>Transactions of the Gaelic
Society of Dublin</i>,) and upon which it appears that the "Darthula"
of Macpherson is founded. The treachery of Conor,
king of Ulster, in putting to death the three sons of Usna, was
the cause of a desolating war against Ulster, which terminated
in the destruction of Eman. "This story (says Mr. <sc>O'Flanagan</sc>)
has been from time immemorial held in high repute as
one of the three tragic stories of the Irish. These are, 'The
death of the children of Touran;' 'The death of the children
of Lear,' (both regarding Tuatha de Danans,) and this, 'The
death of the children of Usnach,' which is a Milesian story."--It
will be recollected, that in the Second Number of these
Melodies, there is a ballad upon the story of the children of
Lear or Lir: "Silent, oh Moyle!" &c.

[Footnote A: These stanzas are founded upon an event of most melancholy
importance to Ireland; if, as we are told by our Irish
historians, it gave England the first opportunity of profiting by
our divisions and subduing us. The following are the circumstances
as related by O'Halloran. "The King of Leinster had
long conceived a violent affection for Dearbhorgil, daughter to
the King of Meath, and though she had been for some time
married to O'Ruark, Prince of Breffni, yet it could not restrain
his passion. They carried on a private correspondence, and
she informed him that O'Ruark intended soon to go on a pilgrimage,
(an act of piety frequent in those days), and conjured
him to embrace that opportunity of conveying her from a husband
she detested to a lover she adored. Mac Murchad too
punctually obeyed the summons, and had the lady conveyed to
his capital of Ferns."--The monarch Roderic espoused the cause
of O'Ruark, while Mac Murchad fled to England, and obtained
the assistance of Henry II.

"Such," adds Giraldus Cambrensis (as I find him in an old
translation), "is the variable and fickle nature of woman, by
whom all mischief in the world (for the most part) do happen
and come, as may appear by Marcus Antonius, and by the
destruction of Troy."]

palace at Almhaim, where the attending Bards, anxious, if
possible, to produce a cessation of hostilities, shook the Chain
of Silence, and flung themselves among the ranks." See also

O'DONOHUE'S MISTRESS[A].


I.

/*
Of all the fair months, that round the sun
In light-link'd dance their circles run,
  Sweet May, sweet May, shine thou for me;
For still, when thy earliest beams arise,
That youth, who beneath the blue lake lies,
  Sweet May, sweet May, returns to me.
*/

[Footnote A: The particulars of the tradition respecting O'Donohue and
his White Horse, may be found in Mr. Weld's Account of Killarney,
or, more fully detailed, in Derrick's Letters. For many
years after his death, the spirit of this hero is supposed to have
been seen, on the morning of May-day, gliding over the lake on
his favourite white horse, to the sound of sweet, unearthly music,
and preceded by groups of youths and maidens, who flung
wreaths of delicate spring-flowers in his path.

Among other stories, connected with this Legend of the
Lakes, it is said that there was a young and beautiful girl,
whose imagination was so impressed with the idea of this visionary
chieftain, that she fancied herself in love with him, and
at last, in a fit of insanity, on a May-morning, threw herself into
the Lake.]

PREFIXED TO THE

FIRST AND SECOND NUMBERS.


Power takes the liberty of announcing to
the Public a <sc>Work</sc> which has long been a
<i>Desideratum</i> in this country. Though the beauties
of the National Music of Ireland have been
very generally felt and acknowledged, yet it has
happened, through the want of appropriate
English words, and of the arrangement necessary
to adapt them to the voice, that many of
the most excellent Compositions have hitherto
remained in obscurity. It is intended, therefore,
to form a Collection of the best Original
<sc>Irish Melodies</sc>, with characteristic Symphonies
and Accompaniments; and with Words
containing, as frequent as possible, allusions to
the manners and history of the Country. Sir
<sc>John Stevenson</sc> has very kindly consented
to undertake the arrangement of the Airs; and
the lovers of simple National Music may rest
secure, that, in such tasteful hands, the native
-----File: p214.png--------------------------------------------------------
charms of the original melody will not be sacrificed
to the ostentation of science.

In the poetical Part, <sc>Power</sc>[**F2 on prev page first word was smallcap "Power" unmarked due to chap begin] has had promises
of assistance from several distinguished
Literary Characters, particularly from Mr.
<sc>Moore</sc>, whose lyrical talent is so peculiarly
suited to such a task, and whose zeal in the undertaking
will be best understood from the following
Extract of a Letter which he has addressed
to Sir <sc>John Stevenson</sc> on the subject:--

/#
"I feel very anxious that a Work of this kind
should be undertaken. We have too long
neglected the only talent, for which our English
Neighbours ever deigned to allow us any
credit. Our National Music has never been
properly collected[A]; and, while the composers
of the Continent have enriched their Operas
and Sonatas with Melodies borrowed from
Ireland,--very often without even the Honesty
of Acknowledgment--we have left these treasures
in a great Degree unclaimed and fugi-*
#/

[Footnote A: The Writer forgot, when he made this assertion, that the Public
are indebted to Mr. <sc>Bunting</sc> for a very valuable Collection of
Irish Music; and that the patriotic genius of Miss <sc>Owenson</sc> has
been employed upon some of our finest Airs.]
-----File: p215.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
*tive. Thus our Airs, like too many of our
Countrymen, for want of protection at home,
have passed into the service of foreigners.
But we are come, I hope, to a better period
both of Politics and Music; and how much
they are connected, in Ireland at least, appears
too plainly in the tone of sorrow and depression
which characterizes most of our early
Songs.--The task which you propose to me,
of adapting words to these airs, is by no means
easy. The Poet, who would follow the various
sentiments which they express, must feel and
understand that rapid fluctuation of spirits,
that unaccountable mixture of gloom and
levity, which composes the character of my
countrymen, and has deeply tinged their
Music. Even in their liveliest strains we
find some melancholy note intrude,--some
minor Third or flat Seventh--which throws
its shade as it passes, and makes even mirth
interesting. If <sc>Burns</sc> had been an Irishman,
(and I would willingly give up all our
claims upon <sc>Ossian</sc> for him,) his heart
would have been proud of such music, and his
genius would have made it immortal.

"Another difficulty (which is, however, purely
#/
-----File: p216.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
mechanical) arises from the irregular structure
of many of those airs, and the lawless
kind of metre which it will in consequence be
necessary to adapt to them. In these instances
the Poet must write, not to the eye,
but to the ear; and must be content to have
his verses of that description which <sc>Cicero</sc>
mentions, '<i>Quos si cantu spoliaveris, nuda
remanebit oratio</i>.' That beautiful Air, 'The
Twisting of the Rope,' which has all the
romantic character of the Swiss <i>Ranz des
Vaches</i>, is one of those wild and sentimental
rakes, which it will not be very easy to tie down
in sober wedlock with Poetry. However, notwithstanding
all these difficulties, and the
very little talent which I can bring to surmount
them, the design appears to me so
truly National, that I shall feel much pleasure
in giving it all the assistance in my
power.

TO THE

THIRD NUMBER.


In presenting the Third Number of this Work
to the Public, <sc>Power</sc> begs leave to offer his
acknowledgments for the very liberal patronage
with which it has been honoured; and to
express a hope that the unabated zeal of
those who have hitherto so admirably conducted
it, will enable him to continue it
through many future Numbers with equal spirit,
variety, and taste. The stock of popular Melodies
is far from being exhausted; and there is
still in reserve an abundance of beautiful Airs,
which call upon Mr. <sc>Moore</sc>, in the language
he so well understands, to save them from the
oblivion to which they are hastening.

<sc>Power</sc> respectfully trusts he will not be
thought presumptuous in saying, that he feels
proud, as an Irishman, in even the very subordinate
share which he can claim, in promoting a
-----File: p218.png--------------------------------------------------------
Work so creditable to the talents of the Country--a
Work, which, from the spirit of nationality
it breathes, will do more, he is convinced,
towards liberalizing the feelings of society, and
producing that brotherhood of sentiment which
it is so much our interest to cherish, than could
ever be effected by the arguments of wise, but
uninteresting, politicians.

THE MARCHIONESS DOWAGER OF DONEGAL,

PREFIXED TO THE

THIRD NUMBER.


While the Publisher of these Melodies very
properly inscribes them to the Nobility and
Gentry of Ireland in general, I have much pleasure
in selecting <i>one</i> from that number, to whom
<i>my</i> share of the Work is particularly dedicated.
Though your Ladyship has been so long absent
from Ireland, I know that you remember it
well and warmly--that you have not allowed
the charm of English society, like the taste of
the lotus, to produce oblivion of your country,
but that even the humble tribute which I offer
derives it[** its?/P2] chief claim upon your interest
from the appeal which it makes to your patriotism.
Indeed absence, however fatal to
some affections of the heart, rather strengthens
our love for the land where we were born; and
-----File: p220.png--------------------------------------------------------
Ireland is the country, of all others, which an
exile must remember with enthusiasm. Those
few darker and less amiable traits, with which
bigotry and misrule have stained her character,
and which are too apt to disgust us upon a
nearer intercourse, become softened at a distance,
or altogether invisible; and nothing is
remembered but her virtues and her misfortunes--the
zeal with which she has always loved
liberty, and the barbarous policy which has
always withheld it from her--the ease with
which her generous spirit might be conciliated,
and the cruel ingenuity which has been exerted
to "wring her into undutifulness[A]."

It has often been remarked, and oftener felt,
that our music is the truest of all comments upon
our history. The tone of defiance, succeeded
by the languor of despondency--a burst of turbulence
dying away into softness--the sorrows
of one moment lost in the levity of the next--and
all that romantic mixture of mirth and sadness,
which is naturally produced by the efforts
of a lively temperament, to shake off, or forget,

[Footnote A: A phrase which occurs in a letter from the Earl of Desmond to
the Earl of Ormond, in Elizabeth's time.--<i>Scrinia Sacra</i>, as quoted
by Curry.]
-----File: p221.png--------------------------------------------------------
the wrongs which lie upon it:--such are the
features of our history and character, which we
find strongly and faithfully reflected in our
music; and there are many airs, which, I think,
it is difficult to listen to, without recalling some
period or event to which their expression seems
peculiarly applicable. Sometimes, when the
strain is open and spirited, yet shaded here and
there by a mournful recollection, we can fancy
that we behold the brave allies of Montrose[A],
marching to the aid of the royal cause, notwithstanding
all the perfidy of Charles and his
ministers, and remembering just enough of past
sufferings to enhance the generosity of their
present sacrifice. The plaintive melodies of
Carolan take us back to the times in which he
lived, when our poor countrymen were driven to
worship their God in caves, or to quit for ever
the land of their birth (like the bird that abandons
the nest, which human touch has violated);
and in many a song do we hear the last farewell

[Footnote A: There are some gratifying accounts of the gallantry of these
Irish auxiliaries in "The Complete History of the Wars in Scotland,
under Montrose" (1660). See particularly, for the conduct of an
Irishman at the battle of Aberdeen, chap 6. p. 49; and, for a tribute
to the bravery of Colonel O'Kyan, chap. 7. p. 55. Clarendon owns
that the Marquis of Montrose was indebted for much of his miraculous
success, to this small band of Irish heroes under Macdonnel--[** Footnote not continued on next page, should probably be a full stop./F2 this could be a missing l, forming Macdonnell, sideways?]]
-----File: p222.png--------------------------------------------------------
of the exile[A], mingling regret for the ties he
leaves at home, with sanguine expectations of
the honours that await him abroad--such honours
as were won on the field of Fontenoy, where the
valour of Irish Catholics turned the fortune of
the day in favour of the French, and extorted
from George the Second that memorable exclamation,
"Cursed be the laws which deprive me
of such subjects!"

Though much has been said of the antiquity
of our music, it is certain that our finest and
most popular airs are modern; and perhaps we
may look no further than the last disgraceful
century for the origin of most of those wild and
melancholy strains, which were at once the
offspring and solace of grief, and which were
applied to the mind, as music was formerly to
the body, "decantare loca dolentia." Mr.

[Footnote A: The associations of the Hindû[** Hindù?] Music, though more obvious and
defined, were far less touching and characteristic. They divided their
songs according to the seasons of the year, by which (says Sir William
Jones) "they were able to recall the memory of autumnal merriment,
at the close of the harvest, or of separation and melancholy during the
cold months, &c."--<i>Asiatic Transactions</i>, vol. 3. on the Musical
Modes of the Hindûs.--What the Abbé du Bos says of the symphonies
of Lully, may be asserted, with much more probability, of our
bold and impassioned airs--"elles auroient produit de ces effets, qui
nous paroissent fabuleux dans le récit des anciens, si on les avoit fait
entendre à des hommes, d'un naturel aussi vif que les Athéniens."--<i>Reflex.
sur la Peinture</i>, &c. tom. 1. sect. 45.]
-----File: p223.png--------------------------------------------------------
Pinkerton is of opinion[A] that none of the Scotch
popular airs are as old as the middle of the sixteenth
century; and though musical antiquaries
refer us, for some of our melodies, to so early a
period as the fifth century, I am persuaded that
there are few, of a <i>civilized</i> description, (and by
this I mean to exclude all the savage Ceanans,
cries[B], <i>&c.</i>[**appear italic?]), which can claim quite so ancient a
date as Mr. Pinkerton allows to the Scotch.
But music is not the only subject upon which
our taste for antiquity is rather unreasonably
indulged; and, however heretical it may be to
dissent from these romantic speculations, I cannot
help thinking that it is possible to love our
country very zealously, and to feel deeply interested
in her honour and happiness, without
believing that Irish was the language spoken in
Paradise[C]; that our ancestors were kind enough
to take the trouble of polishing the Greeks[D]; or
that Abaris, the Hyperborean, was a native of
the North of Ireland[E].

[Footnote A: Dissertation, prefixed to the 2nd volume of his Scottish Ballads.]

[Footnote B: Of which some genuine specimens may be found at the end of
Mr. Walker's Work upon the Irish Bards. Mr. Bunting has disfigured
his last splendid volume by too many of these barbarous rhapsodies.]

-----File: p224.png--------------------------------------------------------

By some of these archæologists it has been
imagined that the Irish were early acquainted
with counter-point[A]; and they endeavour to
support this conjecture by a well-known passage
in Giraldus, where he dilates, with such elaborate
praise, upon the beauties of our national
minstrelsey. But the terms of this eulogy are
too vague, too deficient in technical accuracy,
to prove that even Giraldus himself knew any
thing of the artifice of counterpoint. There are
many expressions in the Greek and Latin writers
which might be cited, with much more plausibility,
to prove that they understood the arrangement
of music in parts[B]; yet I believe it is

[Footnote A: It is also supposed, but with as little proof, that they understood
the diésis, or enharmonic interval.--The Greeks seem to have formed
their ears to this delicate gradation of sound; and, whatever difficulties
or objections may lie in the way of its practical use, we must
agree with Mersenne (Preludes de l'Harmonie, quest. 7.) that the
theory of music would be imperfect without it; and, even in practice,
(as Tosi, among others, very justly remarks, Observations on Florid
Song, chap. 1, sect. 16.) there is no good performer on the violin, who
does not make a sensible difference between D sharp and E flat,
though, from the imperfection of the instrument, they are the same
notes upon the Piano-forte. The effect of modulation by enharmonic
transitions is also very striking and beautiful.]

[Footnote B: The words ποικιλια [**P1 Unsure, is it kappa or something else?][*P3 It is POIKILIA, see https://philarchive.org/archive/FINPAT-4] and ἑτεροφωνια, in a passage of Plato, and
some expressions of Cicero in Fragment, lib. 2, de Republ., induced
the Abbé Fraguier to maintain that the ancients had a knowledge of
counter-point. M. Burette, however, has answered him, I think,
satisfactorily. (Examen d'un passage de Platon, in the 3d vol. of
Histoire de l'Acad.) M. Huet is of opinion, (Pensées Diverses) that
what Cicero says of the music of the spheres, in his dream of Scipio,
is sufficient to prove an acquaintance with harmony; but one of the]*
-----File: p225.png--------------------------------------------------------
conceded in general by the learned, that, however
grand and pathetic the melody of the ancients
may have been, it was reserved for the
ingenuity of modern Science to transmit the
"light of Song" through the variegating prism
of Harmony.

Indeed the irregular scale of the early Irish
(in which, as in the music of Scotland, the interval
of the fourth was wanting[A]) must have
furnished but wild and refractory subjects to the
harmonist. It was only when the invention of
Guido began to be known, and the powers of the
harp[B] were enlarged by additional strings, that

*[Footnote: strongest passages, which I recollect, in favour of the supposition,
occurs in the Treatise, attributed to Aristotle.  Περι Κοσμον--Μουσικη
δε οξεις αμα και βαρεις κ. τ. λ.]

[Footnote A: Another lawless peculiarity of our Music is the frequency of, what
composers call, consecutive fifths; but this is an irregularity, which
can hardly be avoided, by persons not very conversant with the rules
of composition; indeed if I may venture to cite my own wild attempts
in this way, it is a fault which I find myself continually committing,
and which has sometimes appeared so pleasing to my ear,
that I have surrendered it to the critic with considerable reluctance.
May there not be a little pedantry in adhering too rigidly to this
rule?--I have been told that there are instances, in Haydn, of an
undisguised succession of fifths; and Mr. Shield, in his Introduction
to Harmony, seems to intimate, that Handel has been sometimes
guilty of the same irregularity.]

[Footnote B: A singular oversight occurs in an Essay upon the Irish Harp, by
Mr. Beauford, which is inserted in the Appendix to Walker's Historical
Memoirs.--"The Irish (says he), according to Bromton, in the
reign of Henry II. had two kinds of Harps, 'Hibernici tamen in
duobus musici generis instrumentis, quamvis præcipitem et velocem,]*
-----File: p226.png--------------------------------------------------------
our melodies took the sweet character which
interests us at present; and while the Scotch
persevered in the old mutilation of the scale[A],
our music became gradually more amenable to
the laws of harmony and counter-point.

In profiting, however, by the improvements of
the moderns, our style still kept its originality
sacred from their refinements; and though Carolan
had frequent opportunities of hearing the
works of Geminiani and other masters, we but
rarely find him sacrificing his native simplicity to
the ambition of their ornaments, or affectation of

*[Footnote: suavem tamen et jucundam," the one greatly bold and quick, the
other soft and pleasing."--How a man of Mr. Beauford's learning
could so mistake the meaning, and mutilate the grammatical construction
of this extract is unaccountable. The following is the passage
as I find it entire in Bromton, and it requires but little Latin to perceive
the injustice, which has been done to the words of the old
Chronicler:--"Et cum Scotia, hujus terræ filia, utatur lyrâ, tympano
et choro, ac Wallia cithara, tubis et choro Hibernici tamen in duobus
musici generis instrumentis, <i>quamvis præcipitem et velocem, suavem
tamen et jucundam</i>, crispatis modulis et intricatis notulis,
<i>efficiunt harmoniam</i>." Hist. Anglic. Script, pag. 1075.--I should
not have thought this error worth remarking, but that the compiler
of the Dissertation on the Harp, prefixed to Mr. Bunting's last Work
has adopted it implicitly.]

[Footnote A: The Scotch lay claim to some of our best airs, but there are
strong traits of difference between their melodies and ours. They
had formerly the same passion for robbing us of our Saints, and the
learned Dempster was, for this offence, called "The Saint Stealer."
I suppose it was an Irishman, who, by way of reprisal, stole Dempster's
beautiful wife from him at Pisa.--See this anecdote in the
<i>Pinacotheca</i> of Erythræus, part 1, page 25.]
-----File: p227.png--------------------------------------------------------
their science. In that curious composition, indeed,
called his Concerto, it is evident that he
laboured to imitate Corelli; and this union of
manners so very dissimilar produces the same
kind of uneasy sensation, which is felt at a mixture
of different styles of architecture. In general,
however, the artless flow of our music has
preserved itself free from all tinge of foreign
innovation[A], and the chief corruptions, of which
we have to complain, arise from the unskilful
performance of our own itinerant musicians, from
whom, too frequently, the airs are noted down,
encumbered by their tasteless decorations, and
responsible for all their ignorant anomalies.
Though it be sometimes impossible to trace the
original strain, yet, in most of them, "auri per
ramos <i>aura</i> refulget[B]," the pure gold of the
melody shines through the ungraceful foliage
which surrounds it, and the most delicate and

[Footnote A: Among other false refinements of the art, our music (with the
exception perhaps of the air called "Mamma, Mamma," and one or
two more of the same ludicrous description) has avoided that puerile
mimickry of natural noises, motions, &c., which disgraces so often the
works of even the great Handel himself. D'Alembert ought to have
had better taste than to become the patron of this imitative affectation.--<i>Discours
Préliminaire de l'Encyclopédie.</i> The reader may
find some good remarks on the subject in Avison upon Musical
Expression; a work, which, though under the name of Avison, was
written, it is said, by Dr. Brown.]

[Footnote B: Virgil, Æneid, lib. G. v. 204.]
-----File: p228.png--------------------------------------------------------
difficult duty of a compiler is to endeavour, as much
as possible, by retrenching these inelegant superfluities,
and collating the various methods of
playing or singing each air, to restore the regularity
of its form, and the chaste simplicity
of its character.

I must again observe, that, in doubting the
antiquity of our music, my scepticism extends
but to those polished specimens of the art, which
it is difficult to conceive anterior to the dawn of
modern improvement; and that I would by no
means invalidate the claims of Ireland, to as
early a rank in the annals of minstrelsey, as the
most zealous antiquary may be inclined to allow
her. In addition, indeed, to the power, which
music must always have possessed over the minds
of a people so ardent and susceptible, the stimulus
of persecution was not wanting, to quicken
our taste into enthusiasm; the charms of song
were ennobled with the glories of martyrdom,
and the acts against minstrels in the reigns of
Henry VIII., and Elizabeth, were as successful,
I doubt not, in making my countrymen
musicians, as the penal laws have been in keeping
them Catholics.

With respect to the verses which I have
-----File: p229.png--------------------------------------------------------
written for these Melodies, as they are intended
rather to be sung than read, I can answer for
their sound with somewhat more confidence than
their sense; yet, it would be affectation to deny
that I have given much attention to the task,
and that it is not through want of zeal or industry,
if I unfortunately disgrace the sweet airs of
my country, by poetry altogether unworthy of
their taste, their energy, and their tenderness.

Though the humble nature of my contributions
to this work, may exempt them from the rigours
of literary criticisms, it was not to be expected
that those touches of political feeling, those tones
of national complaint, in which the poetry sometimes
sympathizes with the music, would be
suffered to pass without censure or alarm. It
has been accordingly said, that the tendency of
this publication is mischievous[A], and that I
have chosen these airs but as a vehicle of dangerous
politics--as fair and precious vessels (to
borrow an image of St. Augustin[B]), from which
the wine of error might be administered. To

those who identify nationality with treason, and
who see, in every effort for Ireland, a system of
hostility towards England,--to those too, who
nursed in the gloom of prejudice, are alarmed
by the faintest gleam of liberality, that threatens
to disturb their darkness; like that Demophon of
old who, when the sun shone upon him, shivered[A]!--to
such men I shall not deign to apologize, for
the warmth of any political sentiment which
may occur in the course of these pages. But, as
there are many, among the more wise and tolerant,
who, with feeling enough to mourn over
the wrongs of their country, and sense enough
to perceive all the danger of not redressing them,
may yet think that allusions in the least degree
bold or inflammatory, should be avoided in a
publication of this popular description--I beg of
these respected persons, to believe, that there is
no one who deprecates, more sincerely than I
do, any appeal to the passions of an ignorant
and angry multitude; but, that it is not
through that gross and inflammable region of
society, a work of this nature could ever have
been intended to circulate. It looks much higher

[Footnote A: This emblem of modern bigots was head-butler (τραπεζοποιος)
to Alexander the Great. <i>Sext. Empir. Pyrrh. Hypoth.</i> Lib. 1.]
-----File: p231.png--------------------------------------------------------
for its audience and readers--it is found upon
the piano-fortes of the rich, and the educated--of
those, who can afford to have their national
zeal a little stimulated, without exciting much
dread of the excesses into which it may hurry
them; and of many, whose nerves may be, now
and then, alarmed with advantage, as much
more is to be gained by their fears, than could
ever be expected from their justice.

Having thus adverted to the principal objection,
which has been hitherto made to the poetical
part of this work, allow me to add a few
words in defence of my ingenious coadjutor, Sir
John Stevenson, who has been accused of having
spoiled the simplicity of the airs, by the chromatic
richness of his symphonies, and the
elaborate variety of his harmonies. We might
cite the example of the admirable Haydn, who
has sported through all the mazes of musical
science, in his arrangement of the simplest
Scottish melodies; but it appears to me, that
Sir John Stevenson has brought a national feeling
to this task, which it would be in vain to
expect from a foreigner, however tasteful or
judicious. Through many of his own compositions
we trace a vein of Irish sentiment, which
-----File: p232.png--------------------------------------------------------
points him out as peculiarly suited to catch the
spirit of his country's music; and, far from
agreeing with those critics, who think that his
symphonies have nothing kindred with the airs
which they introduce, I would say that, in general,
they resemble those illuminated initials
of old manuscripts, which are of the same character
with the writing which follows, though
more highly coloured[A] and more curiously ornamented.

In those airs, which are arranged for voices,
his skill has particularly distinguished itself,
and, though it cannot be denied that a single
melody most naturally expresses the language of
feeling and passion, yet, often, when a favourite
strain has been dismissed, as having lost its
charm of novelty for the ear, it returns, in a harmonized
shape, with new claims upon our interest
and attention; and to those who study
the delicate artifices of composition, the construction
of the inner parts of these pieces must
afford, I think, considerable satisfaction. Every
voice has an air to itself, a flowing succession of
notes, which might be heard with pleasure, in-*

[Footnote A: The word "chromatic" might have been used here, without any
violence to its meaning.]
-----File: p233.png--------------------------------------------------------
*dependent of the rest, so artfully has the harmonist
(if I may thus express it) <i>gavelled</i> the
melody, distributing an equal portion of its
sweetness to every part.

If your Ladyship's love of Music were not
known to me, I should not have hazarded so long
a letter upon the subject; but as, probably, I
may have presumed too far upon your partiality,
the best revenge you can take is to write me
just as long a letter upon Painting; and I promise
to attend to your theory of the art, with a
pleasure only surpassed by that, which I have
so often derived from your practice of it.--May
the mind which such talents adorn, continue
calm as it is bright, and happy as it is virtuous!

TO THE

FOURTH NUMBER.


This Number of <sc>The Melodies</sc> ought to
have appeared much earlier; and the writer of
the words is ashamed to confess, that the delay
of its publication must be imputed chiefly, if
not entirely, to him. He finds it necessary to
make this avowal, not only for the purpose of
removing all blame from the publisher, but in
consequence of a rumour, which has been circulated
industriously in Dublin, that the Irish
Government had interfered to prevent the continuance
of the Work. This would be, indeed,
a revival of <sc>Henry</sc> the Eighth's enactments
against Minstrels, and it is flattering to find
that so much importance is attached to our compilation,
even by such persons as the inventors
of the report. Bishop <sc>Lowth</sc>, it is true, was
of this opinion that <i>one</i> song, like the <i>Hymn to
Harmodius</i>, would have done more towards
-----File: p236.png--------------------------------------------------------
rousing the spirit of the Romans than <i>all</i> the
philippics of <sc>Cicero</sc>. But we live in wiser
and less musical times; ballads have long lost
their revolutionary powers, and we question if
even a "Lillibullero" would produce any very
<i>serious</i> consequences at present. It is needless,
therefore, to add, that there is no truth in the
report; and we trust that whatever belief it obtained
was founded more upon the character of
<i>the Government</i> than of <i>the Work</i>.

The Airs of the last Number, though full of
originality and beauty, were perhaps in general,
too curiously selected to become all at once as
popular as, we think, they deserve to be. The
Public are remarkably reserved towards new
acquaintances in music, which, perhaps, is one
of the reasons why many modern composers
introduce none but old friends to their notice.
Indeed, it is natural that persons, who love
music only by association, should be slow in
feeling the charms of a new and strange melody;
while those, who have a quick sensibility for this
enchanting art, will as naturally seek and enjoy
novelty, because in every variety of strain they
find a fresh combination of ideas, and the sound
has scarcely reached the ear, before the heart
-----File: p237.png--------------------------------------------------------
has rapidly translated it into sentiment.
After all, however, it cannot be denied that
the most popular of our national Airs are
also the most beautiful; and it has been our
wish, in the present Number, to select from those
Melodies only which have long been listened to
and admired. The least known in the collection
is the Air of "<i>Love's young Dream</i>;" but it
is one of those easy, artless strangers, whose
merit the heart acknowledges instantly.

TO THE

FIFTH NUMBER.


It is but fair to those, who take an interest in
this Work, to state that it is now very near its
termination, and that the Sixth Number, which
shall speedily appear, will, most probably, be
the last of the series. Three Volumes will
then have been completed, according to the original
plan, and the Proprietors desire me to say
that a List of Subscribers will be published with
the concluding Number.

It is not so much from a want of materials,
and still less from any abatement of zeal or
industry, that we have adopted the resolution of
bringing our task to a close; but we feel so
proud, for our country's sake and our own, of
the interest which this purely Irish Work has
excited, and so anxious lest a particle of that
interest should be lost, by any ill-judged protraction
of its existence, that we think it wiser
-----File: p240.png--------------------------------------------------------
to take away the cup from the lip, while its
flavour is yet, we trust, fresh and sweet, than to
risk any longer trial of the charm, or give so
much as not to leave some wish for more. In
speaking thus I allude entirely to the Airs,
which are, of course, the main attraction of these
Volumes; and, though we have still many popular
and delightful Melodies to produce[A], yet it
cannot be denied that we should soon experience
some difficulty, in equalling the richness
and novelty of the earlier Numbers, for which,
as we had the choice of all before us, we naturally
selected only the most rare and beautiful.
The Poetry too would be sure to sympathize
with the decline of the Music; and, however
feebly my words have kept pace with the
<i>excellence</i> of the Airs, they would follow
their <i>falling off</i>, I fear, with wonderful alacrity.
So that, altogether, both pride and prudence
counsel us to stop, while the Work is yet, we
believe, flourishing and attractive, and, in the
imperial attitude "<i>stantes mori</i>," before we

[Footnote A: Among these is <i>Savourna Deelish</i>, which I have hitherto only
withheld, from the diffidence I feel in treading upon the same ground
with Mr. Campbell, whose beautiful words to this fine Air have
taken too strong possession of all ears and hearts, for me to think of
producing any impression after him. I suppose, however, I must
attempt it for the next Number.]
-----File: p241.png--------------------------------------------------------
incur the charge either of altering for the worse
or, what is equally unpardonable, continuing too
long the same.

We beg, however, to say, it is only in the
event of our failing to find Airs as exquisite as
most of those we have given, that we mean thus
to anticipate the natural period of dissolution,
like those Indians, who put their relatives to
death, when they become feeble:--and they,
who wish to retard this Euthanasia of the Irish
Melodies, cannot better effect it than by contributing
to our collection, not, what are called
curious Airs, for we have abundance of them,
and they are, in general, <i>only</i> curious, but any
really sweet and expressive Songs of our Country,
which either chance or research may have
brought into their hands.

TO THE

SIXTH NUMBER.


In presenting this Sixth Number to the Public
as our last, and bidding adieu to the Irish
Harp for ever, we shall not answer very confidently
for the strength of our resolution, nor feel
quite sure that it may not prove, after all, to be
only one of those eternal farewells, which a
lover takes of his mistress occasionally. Our
only motive indeed for discontinuing the Work,
was a fear that our treasures were beginning to
be exhausted, and an unwillingness to descend
to the gathering of mere seed-pearl, after the
very valuable gems it has been our lot to string
together. But this intention, which we announced
in our Fifth Number, has excited an
anxiety in the lovers of Irish Music, not only
pleasant and flattering, but highly useful to us;
for the various contributions we have received in
consequence, have enriched our collection with
-----File: p244.png--------------------------------------------------------
so many choice and beautiful Airs, that if we
keep to our resolution of publishing no more, it
will certainly be an instance of forbearance and
self-command, unexampled in the history of
poets and musicians. To one gentleman in
particular, who has been many years resident in
England, but who has not forgot, among his various
pursuits, either the language or the melodies of
his native country, we beg to offer our best
thanks for the many interesting communications
with which he has favoured us; and we trust that
he and our other friends will not relax in those
efforts by which we have been so considerably
assisted; for though the Work must now be
considered as defunct, yet--as Reaumur, the
naturalist, found out the art of making the cicada
sing after it was dead--it is not impossible that,
some time or other, we may try a similar experiment
upon the Irish Melodies.

TO THE

SEVENTH NUMBER.


If I had consulted only my own judgment,
this Work would not have been extended beyond
the Six Numbers, already published;
which contain, perhaps, the flower of our national
melodies, and have attained a rank in
public favour, of which I would not willingly risk
the forfeiture, by degenerating, in any way, from
those merits that were its source. Whatever
treasures of our music were still in reserve, (and
it will be seen, I trust, that they are numerous
and valuable,) I would gladly have left to future
poets to glean, and, with the ritual words "<i>tibi
trado</i>," would have delivered up the torch into
other hands, before it had lost much of its light
in my own. But the call for a continuance of
the work has been, as I understand from the
Publisher, so general, and we have received so
-----File: p246.png--------------------------------------------------------
many contributions of old and beautiful airs[A],
the suppression of which, for the enhancement of
those we have published, would resemble too
much the policy of the Dutch in burning their
spices, that I have been persuaded, though not
without considerable diffidence in my success,
to commence a new series of the Irish Melodies.

[Footnote A: One Gentleman, in particular, whose name I shall feel happy in
being allowed to mention, has not only sent us near forty ancient airs,
but has communicated many curious fragments of Irish poetry, and
some interesting traditions, current in the country where he resides,
illustrated by sketches of the romantic scenery to which they refer;
all of which, though too late for the present Number, will be of infinite
service to us in the prosecution of our task.]
